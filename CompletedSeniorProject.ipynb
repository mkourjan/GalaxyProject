    "Methods of teaching numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations in the context of galaxy mergers were explored. The research published in a paper by Toomre and Toomre in 1972 describing the formation of galactic tails and bridges from close tidal interactions was adapted into a project targeting undergraduate physics students. Typically undergraduate physics students only take one Computational Physics class in which various techniques and algorithms are taught. Although it is important to study computational physics techniques, it is just as important to apply this knowledge to a problem that is representative of what computational physics researchers are investigating today. The model that was developed is capable of showing general trends in galactic evolution and is a good introduction for students who hope to expand on this topic in the future."

    "Computational physics is based upon the idea that a computer can simulate certain physical environments to produce novel scientific conclusions.  This field allows scientists to conduct experiments on the computer that are just not realistic or possible to do in the real world because of the investigation of topics involving extremely large data sets and complicated physical interactions[1].  This paper investigates the components and processes of modeling galaxy mergers on an undergraduate academic level.  The project outlined in this paper is derived from a paper written by Toomre and Toomre in 1972 that described the formation of galactic tails and bridges from close tidal interactions [2]. This project could be assigned to undergraduate students in an introductory computational physics class to demonstrate the capabilities and possibilities of what the field has to offer.  \n",

    "The galaxy mergers project teaches students numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations.  The galaxies modeled interact via ordinary differential equations so students are able to learn about these techniques through an applied project that is a simplified version of a cutting edge computational physics topic today[3].  A lot of the time undergraduate physics students only take one computational physics class in which they learn about various techniques and algorithms that can in theory be applied to model more complicated physical situations [4].  Although it is important to learn about the underlying theory and algorithms, it is just as important to apply this knowledge to a problem that is representative of what computational physics researchers are investigating today.  The project in this paper does in fact accomplish this goal and teaches numerical methods through application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this project uses ordinary differential equations to model galaxy mergers, currently computational physics researchers use supercomputers to solve partial differential equations using the Boltzmann approximation [5].  The cutting edge research today accounts for the evolution of black holes and dark matter, star formation, and the interactions between individual stars [6, 7, 8, 9].  These characteristics are important in modeling galaxy mergers, but supercomputers are needed to compute all of the calculations.  Our model works well enough to see general trends in galactic shapes and is a good introduction for students who want to expand on this topic in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Toomre and Toomre’s paper dates back to 1972, it is still a good model to use for undergraduate students in a computational physics class.  Their research provided good and accurate results despite the assumptions and simplifications that they made.  Researchers today can produce more precise results and investigate a larger range of topics than in 1972, but the foundation for producing these results is still the same.  This project is an excellent introduction to the capabilities of computational physics and is a great learning opportunity for undergraduate physics students.  \n"

    "Galaxies are a collection of stars that are orbiting around their common center of mass, interacting through gravity.  Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, but the scientist Edwin Hubble designed a classification system for galaxies that is still used today.  He grouped galaxies into four categories including elliptical, spiral, disk, and irregular.  Today we have expanded upon these four groups, but only to add subcategories.  Today elliptical galaxies can be classified according to the ratio between their minor axis and major axis dimensions to differentiate between more circular as opposed to more elongated shapes.  Spiral galaxies are now classified with how tight or loose the spiral arms are, and whether or not there are a cluster of stars in a bar shape in the center of the galaxy.  Disk galaxies are considered to be a transition point between elliptical and spiral galaxies, and were added to the classification system by Hubble approximately 10 years after he created the original one.   Although there are galaxy classification systems in place, a galaxy does not necessarily maintain its shape throughout its life time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies can change shape due to galactic mergers and interactions.  When one galaxy approaches or collides with another, the gravitational force between the two can be so strong that the general shapes of the galaxies can forever be changed.  For instance gravitational interactions with other galaxies have been known to morph the arms of spiral galaxies, change or add the bar structure in spiral galaxies, add features such as tidal tails, and sometimes completely merge the two galaxies together [10].  This paper examines how the positions of individual stars in one galaxy can change with an interaction of another galaxy.  This is important in the grand scheme of things, because this project allows students to predict how a galaxy’s shape can morph over time in various situations.  Trends in galactic morphology are easily visible in this project despite the simplifications that were made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our modern understanding of cosmology indicates that a large fraction of the total matter in the universe is in fact dark matter.  Dark matter does not emit or absorb light and is therefore virtually invisible.  Dark matter is able to interact gravitationally with other matter, so it can be detected by observing trajectories of visible matter.  For example the orbital velocity of visible matter as a function of radius from the center of spiral galaxies does not follow the standard Keplerian motion one would expect for a system with most of the mass concentrated at the center.  In fact, the orbital velocities are larger which suggests that the mass increases more than expected along the galactic radius.  This phenomenon suggests the presence of dark matter in galaxies [11]. Dark matter is distributed non-uniformly throughout the universe. When modeling galaxy mergers and interactions, advanced computer models use smooth particle hydrodynamics to model the diffuse gas and dark matter components of the galaxies.  These simulations can convert the gas into new star populations while the dark matter interacts gravitationally through mean field approximations[3].  Our simplified model ignored these components of galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Supermassive black holes are believed to reside in the center of galaxies due to their strong gravitational pull in relation to their size [12].  Recently a black hole was discovered in the center of a quasar that was 12 billion times the mass of our sun [13].  It is hypothesized that super massive black holes are actually formed through galaxy mergers [14].  Since the universe is expanding, the early universe was a lot more compact and more galactic interactions were able to occur. The kind of computational modeling used in this project therefore provides students a way to study galactic mergers and the interactions of black holes in the early universe.  \n"

    "Galaxies are very complicated entities and there are a lot of factors that can contribute to the positions and velocities of stars.  First of all, galaxies contain an uneven distribution of matter which is very difficult to model.  Second of all, the stars themselves interact gravitationally with each other despite ultimately orbiting around the galactic center.  These factors involve advanced computational techniques and equipment that is more serious than an average computer that an undergraduate student may own.  Following the example of Toomre and Toomre [2], the simulation was simplified so that the stars in this project were treated as unit mass point objects which do not interact with each other but do interact with a large, concentrated galactic core point mass of $10^{11}$ solar masses in the center of the galaxy.  The unit-mass stars were oriented in rings around the galactic center.  The two interacting galaxies were labeled \"main\" and \"disruptor\", with unit mass stars orbiting the main galaxy but none orbiting the disruptor.  Although the disrupting galaxy could follow either hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptical approach trajectories, this simulation only computed parabolic trajectories.  These simplifications made it possible to conduct the computations at each time step using Newtonian gravity differential equations that describe the motion. Figure 1 shows the orbital geometries and variables used in the simulation.\n",

Each ring contains 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 stars respectively (the inner most ring contains 12 stars).  For the direct passage, retrograde passage, and light mass disruptor cases the concentric rings are placed at exactly 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 percent of the minimum distance between the two galaxies $R_{min}$, as shown in Figure 3. \n",

To compute and visualize the simulations, several Python-based numerical tools in the NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy packages were used, including SciPy's `odeint` differential equation integrator and the iPython interact features.

The minimum separation distance between the two galaxies, $R_{min}$, is set at 25 kpc.  The minimum velocity at $R_{min}$ is determined using equation [8] allowing for variable values of the galactic masses.  The angular momentum and $c$ parameter of the parabolic trajectory are determined using these values according to equations [5] and [6].  The $c$ parameter is used to compute the corresponding initial horizontal position of the disturbing galaxy ($X_0$) which in turn can be used to compute the distance of the disturbing galaxy from the origin ($R_0$) according to [7].  The unit tangent vectors are then determined for the parabolic trajectory and are used to set the initial “X” and “Y” velocities of the disturbing galaxy.  The function returns initial “X” and “Y” positions and velocities of the disturbing galaxy.\n",

The variable `particles` describes the number of stars that are desired in one ring around the center of the stationary galaxy.  The variable `percent` describes at what percentage of $R_{min}$ the distance between each star and the origin of the stationary galaxy should be. Lastly, `G` is used for the Universal gravitational constant in appropriate units, and `M` is the desired mass of the stationary galaxy. First the radius of each star is defined as a percent of the $R_{min}$ value set in the previous function.  The stars can be plotted along a circular trajectory around the origin of the stationary galaxy.  The arc length of each trajectory is divided among each ring of stars so that the stars are spaced equally apart.   This is accomplished through a while loop that fills the star locations in an initially empty array with each turn of the loop.  The loop runs as many times as there are stars to be created.   Although the star locations are initially computed in polar coordinates, their positions are converted to Cartesian coordinates and appended to an empty list.  The initial velocity conditions are also created using equation [8].  These velocities are tangent to the circle that the stars are plotted along.  This function returns an array of star positions and an array of star velocities. \n",

There are two ‘init-ring’ functions to allow for different numbers of stars and different percentage locations used for the different cases.  Specifically, each ring in every case contains 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 stars respectively (the inner most ring contains 12 stars).  For the direct passage, retrograde passage, and light mass disruptor cases the concentric rings are placed at exactly 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 percent of the minimum distance between the two galaxies ($R_{min}$) while in the heavy mass disruptor case the rings are placed at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 percent of $R_{min}$.

This can be accomplished by writing a for loop that loops through the rings and velocity arrays and selects the desired information using indexing techniques and appending the proper information to an initially empty list.

The four cases were direct passage, retrograde passage, light mass disruptor and heavy mass disruptor.  Direct passage occurs when the stationary galaxy and disrupting galaxy have equal mass, and the disrupting galaxy approaches the stationary one along a parabola with the same direction that the stars are orbiting.   Retrograde passage is very similar except the disrupting galaxy approaches in the opposite direction that the stars are orbiting.  A way to visualize these concepts is that the stars are orbiting counter clockwise and in a direct passage the galaxy approaches counter clockwise as well, whereas in the retrograde passage the disruptor follows a clockwise trajectory.  A light mass disruptor was also modeled where the disrupting galaxy approached along a direct approach, but had only a quarter of the mass of the stationary galaxy.  The heavy mass disruptor on the other hand was also a direct approach, but the disruptor had four times the galactic mass of the stationary galaxy.  We confirmed that our simulations of these cases matched the results published in [2], demonstrating that it can be used to explore new configurations with confidence that the physics is valid. Below is a demonstration of the direct passage case modeled after the Toomre and Toomre results."

    "After a student gets this project working, they may build upon the existing program with the following suggestions.  First, it may be interesting to examine the trajectory of a single star and follow its path.  One way to do this is to color a particular star in a different color to make it stand out amongst the other stars.  The method to accomplish this is described in the previous section called \"Setup of the General Code\" under the `Make_yellow_star` description. This modification allows students to see which stars are transferred to the disturbing galaxy and which stars stay with their own galaxy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another modification may be to add stars to the disturbing galaxy following similar rules as modeling stars around the stationary galaxy.  It would be interesting for a student to examine how the different stars mix together over time by color coding the stars based on which galaxy they came from.  Also the student can manipulate the tilts of the interacting galaxies and study how the star trajectories are affected with this modification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally it would be interesting to include gravitational interactions between the stars.  This suggestion would take the most computing power and therefore it is recommended for a student to start with only three stars.  Once a student acccomplishes this extension with three stars, they may add more as long as their computer can process the information. \n"

    "Computational Physics is a very broad field that covers many interesting topics.  This project focuses on modeling galaxy interactions, a sub-topic of astrophysics and cosmology.  Galaxies have many complicated factors such as dark matter, black holes, and star-star interactions that computational physicists must model on super computers. Super computers are not commonly available to undergraduate physics students, therefore this project was created to let students model galaxies using the iPython notebook on their laptops.  The project was modeled after the 1972 Toomre and Toomre paper that described the formation of galactic tails and bridges.  Toomre and Toomre imposed certain simplifications on their model including unit-mass stars, no dark matter or black holes, and a finite number of particles to track.  These assumptions were then adopted into this project.  Although the model is not as precise as  cutting-edge research that is currently being conducted on galaxy mergers, the model is definitely good enough to see general trends and is therefore interesting for undergraduates to study.

    "I would like to thank the College Based Academic Fee (CBF) for funding my research.  This money allowed me to spend my summer developing this project into what it has become.  Additionally I would like to acknowledge the Spring 2014 Physics on a Computer class that introduced me to the topic of modeling Galaxy Mergers.  This class is really where this project began!  Last of all I would like to thank my wonderful advisor Jennifer Klay for her patience and hardwork in making this project a reality.  "

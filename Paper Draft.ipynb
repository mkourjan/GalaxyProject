Typically undergraduate physics students only take one Computational Physics class in which various techniques and algorithms are taught.  Although it is important to study computational physics techniques, it is just as important to apply this knowledge to a problem that is representative of what computational physics researchers are investigating today.

      "Computational physics is based upon the idea that a computer can simulate certain physical environments to produce novel scientific conclusions.  This field allows scientists to conduct experiments on the computer that are just not realistic or possible to do in the real world because it is used to investigate topics that involve extremely large data sets and complicated physical interactions[1].  This paper investigates the components and processes of modeling galaxy mergers on an undergraduate academic level.  The project outlined in this paper is derived from a paper written by Toomre and Toomre in 1972 that described the formation of galactic tails and bridges from close tidal interactions [2]. This project could be assigned to undergraduate students in an introductory computational physics class to demonstrate the capabilities and possibilities of what the field has to offer.  \n",

      "The galaxy mergers project teaches students numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations.  The galaxies modeled interact via ordinary differential equations so students are able to learn about these techniques through an applied project that is a simplified version of a cutting edge computational physics topic today[3].  A lot of the time undergraduate physics students only take one computational physics class in which they learn about various techniques and algorithms that can in theory be applied to model more complicated physical situations [4].  Although it is important to learn about the underlying theory and algorithms, it is just as important to apply this knowledge to a problem that is representative of what computational physics researchers are investigating today.  The project in this paper does in fact accomplish this goal and teaches numerical methods through application.\n",
      "Although this project uses ordinary differential equations to model galaxy mergers, currently computational physics researchers use super computers to solve partial differential equations using the Boltzmann approximation [5].  The cutting edge research today accounts for the evolution of black holes and dark matter, star formation, and the interactions between individual stars [6, 7, 8, 9].  These characteristics are important in modeling galaxy mergers, but super computer are needed to compute all of the calculations.  Our model works well enough to see general trends in galactic shapes and is a good introduction for students who want to expand on this topic in the future.\n",

      "Although Toomre and Toomre\u2019s paper dates back to 1972, it is still a good model to use for undergraduate students in a computational physics class.  Their research provided good and accurate results despite the assumptions and simplifications that they made.  Researchers today can produce more precise results and investigate a larger range of topics than in 1972, but the foundation for producing these results is still the same.  This project is an excellent introduction to the capabilities of computational physic s and is a great learning opportunity for undergraduate physics students.  \n",

      "Galaxies are a collection of stars that are orbiting around a common center which sometimes happens to be a black hole.  Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, but the scientist Edwin Hubble designed a classification system for galaxies that is still used today.  He grouped galaxies into four categories including elliptical, spiral, disk, and irregular.  Today we have expanded upon these four groups, but only to add subcategories.  Today elliptical galaxies can be classified according to the ratio between their minor axis and major axis dimensions to differentiate between more circular as opposed to more elongated shapes.  Spiral galaxies are now classified with how tight or loose the spiral arms are, and whether or not there are a cluster of stars in a bar shape in the center of the galaxy.  Disk galaxies are considered to be a transition point between elliptical and spiral galaxies, and were added to the classification system by Hubble approximately 10 years after he created the original one.   Although there are galaxy classification systems in place, a galaxy does not necessarily maintain its shape throughout its life time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Galaxies can change shape due to galactic mergers and interactions.  When one galaxy approaches or collides with another, the gravitational force between the two can be so strong that the general shapes of the galaxies can forever be changed.  For instance gravitational interactions with other galaxies have been known to morph the arms of spiral galaxies, change or add the bar structure in spiral galaxies, add features such as tidal tails, and sometimes completely merge the two galaxies together [1].  This paper examines how the positions of individual stars in one galaxy can change with an interaction of another galaxy.  This is important in the grand scheme of things, because this project allows students to predict how a galaxy\u2019s shape can morph over time in various situations.  Trends in galactic morphology are easily visible in this project despite the simplifications that were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our modern understanding of cosmology indicates that a large fraction of the total matter in the universe is in fact dark matter.  Dark matter does not omit or absorb light and is therefore virtually invisible.  Dark matter is able to interact gravitationally with other matter, so it can be detected by observing trajectories of visible matter.  Some trajectories appear to defy the existing laws of Physics; these trajectories can be explained by the presence of this invisible matter [2].  Dark matter is distributed non-uniformly throughout the universe. When modeling galaxy mergers and interactions, advanced computer models take dark matter into account by using mean field approximation.  This is a procedure that takes a significant amount of computing power and is therefore omitted from our model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black holes are not unusual to occur in the centers of galaxies.  They are very dense and create a large amount of gravity with respect to their size which makes them optimal to orbit around.  Recently a black hole was discovered in the center of a quasar that was 12 billion times the mass of our sun [3].  It is hypothesized that super massive black holes are actually formed through galaxy mergers.  Since the universe is expanding exponentially, the early universe was a lot more compact and more galactic interactions were able to occur.  It would be interesting to apply this project to the study of galactic mergers and the interactions of black holes in the early universe.   \n",

      "Galaxies are very complicated entities and there are a lot of factors that can contribute to the positions and velocities of stars.  First of all, galaxies contain an uneven distribution of matter which is very difficult to model.  Second of all, the stars themselves interact gravitationally with each other despite ultimately orbiting around the galactic center.  These factors involve advanced computational techniques and equipment that is more serious than an average computer that an undergraduate student may own.  Due to these complicated factors, the stars in this project are considered mass-less, and all of the galactic mass occurs as a point mass in the center of the galaxy.  The mass-less stars were oriented in rings around the galactic.  Additionally it was stated that any galaxy that acts as a disruptor will simply be a point mass and not have any stars around it.  These simplifications make it possible to conduct the computations at each time step using differential equations that describe motion.\n",

      "Although many situations could be modeled using this particular model, this project focused on just four cases that could be confirmed against existing research.  The four cases were direct passage, retrograde passage, light mass disruptor and heavy mass disruptor.  Direct passage occurs when the stationary galaxy and disrupting galaxy have equal mass, and the disrupting galaxy approaches the stationary one along a parabola with the same direction that the stars are orbiting.   Retrograde passage is very similar except the disrupting galaxy approaches in the opposite direction that the stars are orbiting.  A way to visual these concepts is that the stars are orbiting counter clockwise and in a direct passage the galaxy approaches counter clockwise as well whereas the retrograde passage follows a clockwise trajectory.  A light mass disruptor was also modeled where the disrupting galaxy approaches along a direct approach, but had only a quarter of the mass of the stationary galaxy.  The heavy mass disruptor on the other hand was also a direct approach, but the disruptor had four times the galactic mass of the stationary galaxy.  These four cases were taken from the Toomre and Toomre paper (reference in other paragraph), and the results were indeed confirmed against their conclusions.   It was important to validate these cases against existing cases so that it could be confirmed that this model was a good one.  Once that was determined, it is now evident that this model can be confidently applied to other situations and cases where the outcome is unknown and one can be confident that the results are realistic."

A function was written that depended on the initial \u201cy\u201d condition of the disturbing galaxy (Ry0), the mass of the stationary galaxy (M), and the mass of the disturbing galaxy (S).  The minimum separation distance between the two galaxies was called Rmin, which was set at 25 kpc.  The minimum velocity at Rmin was set as well following equation [8] with variable values of galactic masses.  The angular momentum was determined using these values which allow for the c factor to be computed according to equations [5] and [6].  The c factor was used to compute the corresponding initial \u201cX\u201d position of the disturbing galaxy (Rx0) which in turn could be used to compute the distance of the disturbing galaxy from the origin (R0) according to [7].  The unit tangent vectors were then determined for the parabola trajectory which were used to set the initial \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d velocities of the disturbing galaxy.  The function returns initial \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d positions and velocities of the disturbing galaxy.\n",

      "A function was set up where formulas and empty lists were set up to produce initial conditions of the stars around the stationary galaxy.  This function took in arguments called particles, percent, G, and M.  Particles described the number of stars that were desired in one ring around the center of the stationary galaxy.  Percent described at what percentage of Rmin the distance between each star and the origin of the stationary galaxy should be. Lastly, G described a gravitational constant and M was the mass of the stationary galaxy. First the radius of each star was defined as a percent of the Rmin value set in the previous function.  The stars can be plotted along a circular trajectory around the origin of the stationary galaxy.  The arc length of each trajectory is divided among each ring of stars so that the stars are spaced equally apart.  This is accomplished by creating a while loop that produces a star location with each turn of the loop.  The loop runs as many times as there are stars to be created.   Although the stars are initially in polar coordinates, their positions are converted to Cartesian coordinates and appended to an empty list.  The initial velocity conditions are also created using equation [8].  These velocities are tangent to the circle that the stars are plotted along.  This function returns an array of star positions and an array of star velocities. \n",

      "When developing this project, the biggest challenge that we encountered was that all of the parameters and initial conditions had to be scientifically accurate in order to produce realistic results.  We began by setting arbitrary initial velocity conditions for our galaxy and stars.  After we did this, we noticed that the parabolic trajectory was significantly tilted and that the disrupted stars did not form galactic tails and bridges as Toomre and Toomre predicted.  In order to solve this problem, we used the velocity equations described previously to set our conditions.  \n",

      "Another important aspect to be aware of is that it is extremely important to set a good time step.  We initially started the project with a timestep that was too large (0.01x10^8 years) and we noticed that our stars would disappear with time.  This problem was especially prominent with the heavy mass disruptor case where every single star would disappear by the time 20x10^8 years went by in our program.  We eventually discovered that our time step was too large and that our stars would jump to the origin when their positions were not calculated frequently enough with the close proximity of the disrupting galaxy.  Essentially the stars did not quite make it around on their orbits and they would jump to the origin and layer themselves on top of one another creating the illusion that they disappeared.  A recommended timestep to use to avoid this problem is 0.007x10^8 years.\n",

      "Computational Physics is a very broad field that covers many interesting topics.  This project focuses on modeling Galaxies which is a sub-category of computational physics.  Galaxies have many complicated factors such as dark matter, black holes, and star-star interactions that computational physicists must model on super computers. Super computers are not commonly available to undergraduate physics students, therefore this project was created that allows students to model galaxies using the iPython notebook on their laptops.  The project was modeled after the 1972 Toomre and Toomre paper that described the formation of galactic tails and bridges.  Toomre and Toomre imposed certain simplifications on their model including mass-less stars, no dark matter or black holes, and the use of 120 stars.  These assumptions were then adopted into this project.  Although the model is not as precise as some of the cutting-edge research that is currently being conducted, the model is definitely good enough to see galactic trends and is therefore interesting to study.
